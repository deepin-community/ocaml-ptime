Description: POSIX time for OCaml (development)
 Ptime has platform independent POSIX time support in pure OCaml. It
 provides a type to represent a well-defined range of POSIX timestamps
 with picosecond precision, conversion with date-time values,
 conversion with RFC 3339 timestamps and pretty printing to a
 human-readable, locale-independent representation.
 .
 This package contains development files.
